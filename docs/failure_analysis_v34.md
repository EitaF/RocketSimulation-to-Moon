# Failure Analysis Report v34

**Date:** July 7, 2025  
**Analysis Scope:** Monte Carlo Campaign Results (42 completed runs)  
**Success Rate:** 0% (0/42 successful missions)  
**Target:** 95% mission success rate

## Executive Summary

The Monte Carlo campaign revealed a **critical system failure** affecting 100% of mission attempts. All 42 completed simulation runs failed in the "failed" phase, indicating a fundamental issue with the mission architecture that prevents any successful lunar missions.

## Critical Findings

### 1. Universal Mission Failure
- **Failure Rate:** 100% (42/42 runs failed)
- **Primary Failure Mode:** All missions terminated in "failed" phase
- **Mission Duration:** Average 645 seconds (10.75 minutes)
- **Performance Characteristics:**
  - Average ΔV achieved: ~7,800 m/s
  - Maximum altitude: ~250-280 km
  - Maximum velocity: ~4,200-4,600 m/s

### 2. Failure Pattern Analysis

#### Consistent Failure Characteristics:
- **Phase:** All failures occur in "failed" phase
- **Duration:** Failures consistently around 620-680 seconds into mission
- **Altitude at Failure:** 230-290 km range
- **Velocity at Failure:** 4,000-4,600 m/s range

#### Performance Metrics:
- **Stage Performance:** All propellant margins show 0.0%, indicating complete fuel depletion
- **ΔV Budget:** ~7,800 m/s achieved vs theoretical requirement of ~11,000+ m/s for lunar mission
- **No LEO Parameters:** Missing LEO apoapsis, periapsis, and insertion data indicates failure before stable orbit

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issue: Insufficient Vehicle Performance

Based on the failure patterns, the root cause appears to be **fundamental vehicle performance deficit**:

1. **Inadequate ΔV Capability**
   - Achieved: ~7,800 m/s
   - Required for lunar mission: ~11,000+ m/s
   - **Deficit: ~3,200 m/s (29% shortfall)**

2. **Premature Fuel Exhaustion**
   - All stages showing 0.0% propellant margin
   - Mission termination around 10-11 minutes (typical for stage 2/3 transition)
   - No successful LEO insertion achieved

3. **Mission Architecture Issues**
   - Likely failing during or immediately after stage 2 completion
   - Unable to achieve stable parking orbit for TLI preparation
   - Vehicle mass/propellant configuration insufficient for mission requirements

### Secondary Contributing Factors

1. **Duration Consistency**
   - Tight clustering around 645±25 seconds suggests systematic failure point
   - Indicates specific mission phase where vehicle performance becomes inadequate

2. **Parameter Variations Impact**
   - Monte Carlo variations (±2%) not significantly affecting failure mode
   - Suggests core performance deficit overwhelms small variations
   - System is fundamentally under-designed for mission requirements

## Specific Failure Modes Identified

### Failure Mode 1: Stage 2/3 Transition Failure (100% of cases)
- **Description:** Mission fails during or immediately after stage 2 burn completion
- **Root Cause:** Insufficient propellant/performance to achieve LEO
- **Impact:** Prevents any possibility of TLI or lunar trajectory
- **Evidence:** 
  - Consistent failure timing (~645 seconds)
  - Zero successful LEO insertions
  - Complete propellant depletion

### Failure Mode 2: ΔV Budget Shortfall (100% of cases)
- **Description:** Vehicle cannot achieve minimum velocity requirements
- **Root Cause:** Under-sized propellant loads or inefficient staging
- **Impact:** Mission termination before reaching orbital velocity
- **Evidence:**
  - Maximum achieved ΔV ~7,800 m/s
  - Required ΔV for mission >11,000 m/s
  - No runs achieving orbital parameters

### Failure Mode 3: System Integration Issues (100% of cases)
- **Description:** Mission architecture unable to proceed beyond ascent phase
- **Root Cause:** Fundamental design mismatch between vehicle capability and mission requirements
- **Impact:** Complete mission failure before lunar trajectory phases
- **Evidence:**
  - No TLI burns recorded
  - No coast phases achieved
  - No lunar orbit insertion attempts

## Recommended Solutions

### Critical Actions (Priority 1 - Required for any mission success)

1. **Vehicle Performance Redesign**
   - **Action:** Increase propellant capacity by minimum 30%
   - **Target:** Achieve >11,000 m/s total ΔV capability
   - **Implementation:** Modify stage mass ratios in `vehicle.py`

2. **Staging Logic Review**
   - **Action:** Optimize stage separation timing and burn profiles
   - **Target:** Achieve stable LEO with >500 m/s remaining ΔV for TLI
   - **Implementation:** Review `guidance.py` and staging algorithms

3. **Mission Architecture Validation**
   - **Action:** Verify end-to-end mission profile feasibility
   - **Target:** Successful LEO insertion in >90% of nominal cases
   - **Implementation:** Baseline mission analysis without variations

### System Improvements (Priority 2 - Required for robust operations)

1. **Propellant Margin Analysis**
   - **Action:** Implement minimum propellant margins for each stage
   - **Target:** 5% minimum margin per stage for contingencies
   - **Implementation:** Add margin checks in propulsion system

2. **Performance Monitoring**
   - **Action:** Enhanced telemetry during critical phases
   - **Target:** Real-time performance vs. required metrics
   - **Implementation:** Expand monitoring in `rocket_simulation_main.py`

3. **Abort and Recovery Systems**
   - **Action:** Implement graceful failure modes
   - **Target:** Safe mission termination with diagnostic data
   - **Implementation:** Enhanced abort logic in mission control

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (Before Next MC Campaign)

1. **Fix Core Vehicle Performance**
   - Increase Stage 1 propellant mass by 20%
   - Increase Stage 2 propellant mass by 25%  
   - Verify Stage 3 sizing for TLI requirements
   - **Expected Impact:** Enable LEO insertion capability

2. **Validation Testing**
   - Run single nominal mission to verify LEO capability
   - Confirm ΔV budget meets minimum requirements
   - Test TLI initiation from stable orbit
   - **Expected Impact:** Prove basic mission feasibility

3. **Reduced Scope Monte Carlo**
   - Run 50-run campaign with improved vehicle
   - Focus on LEO insertion success rate first
   - Gradually expand to full mission profile
   - **Expected Impact:** Identify remaining failure modes

### Long-term Improvements

1. **Design Optimization**
   - Structural mass reduction analysis
   - Engine performance optimization
   - Trajectory optimization for fuel efficiency

2. **Reliability Engineering**
   - Failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA)
   - Redundancy analysis for critical systems
   - Mission success probability modeling

## Conclusion

The current mission architecture has a **fundamental vehicle performance deficit** preventing any successful lunar missions. The 100% failure rate indicates systemic issues requiring immediate design changes before statistical analysis of mission robustness is meaningful.

**Priority:** Address core vehicle performance before proceeding with reliability analysis. The current 0% success rate renders Monte Carlo robustness analysis premature until basic mission capability is established.

**Recommendation:** Implement Priority 1 actions immediately, then re-run validation testing to verify basic mission feasibility before proceeding with full Monte Carlo campaigns.
