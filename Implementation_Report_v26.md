## 1. Monte Carlo Campaign Resumption

### **Problem Addressed**
Long-running Monte Carlo campaigns were vulnerable to being lost due to system restarts or accidental termination.

### **Solution Implemented**
Implemented a comprehensive state management system with automatic resumption capabilities.

#### **Technical Implementation:**

**1.1 State Persistence (`monte_carlo_simulation.py`)**
```python
def _save_campaign_state(self, completed_runs: int) -> None:
    """Save campaign state for resumption"""
    state = {
        'completed_runs': completed_runs,
        'random_state': np.random.get_state(),
        'timestamp': time.time(),
        'config_path': self.config_path
    }
    # Save to campaign_state.json with JSON serialization
```

**1.2 Command Line Interface**
```bash
# Start new campaign
python monte_carlo_simulation.py

# Resume interrupted campaign  
python monte_carlo_simulation.py --resume
```

**1.3 Automatic State Saving**
- Saves state every N runs (configurable, default: 10)
- Preserves NumPy random number generator state
- Tracks completed run count and timestamps

#### **Validation Results**
```
âœ… Campaign interrupted after 150/1000 runs
âœ… Resumed successfully from run 151
âœ… Final statistics show exactly 1000 unique run IDs
âœ… Statistical integrity maintained (no duplicate seeds)
```

## 2. 2D Engine Performance Model

### **Problem Addressed**
Engine model assumed Specific Impulse (Isp) was only altitude-dependent. Real engines have throttle-dependent performance affecting landing simulations and variable thrust maneuvers.

### **Solution Implemented**
Upgraded engine model to support 2D interpolation (altitude + throttle) with enhanced data schema.

#### **Technical Implementation:**

**2.1 Enhanced Data Schema (`engine_curve.json`)**
```json
{
  "S-IC": {
    "isp_curve": {
      "1.0": {  // 100% throttle
        "0": 263,
        "100000": 289
      },
      "0.8": {  // 80% throttle  
        "0": 258,
        "100000": 284
      },
      "0.6": {  // 60% throttle
        "0": 252, 
        "100000": 278
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**2.2 2D Interpolation Engine (`engine.py`)**
```python
# RectBivariateSpline for altitude + throttle interpolation
isp_spline = RectBivariateSpline(throttle_levels, alt_points, isp_grid)

def get_specific_impulse(self, stage_name: str, altitude: float, throttle: float = 1.0) -> float:
    """Get Isp with throttle dependency"""
    if stage_data['isp_2d']:
        isp = float(isp_interpolator(throttle, altitude)[0, 0])
    return max(100, isp)
```

#### **Performance Validation**
```
S-IC Stage at 50km altitude:
  Throttle 100%: Isp=276.0s, Thrust=34850kN
  Throttle  80%: Isp=271.0s, Thrust=27880kN  
  Throttle  60%: Isp=265.0s, Thrust=20910kN

âœ… Isp decreases with reduced throttle (realistic behavior)
âœ… Thrust scales linearly with throttle setting
âœ… Unit tests pass with <2% MAE requirement
```

## 3. Advanced Fault Detection: Stuck Sensors

### **Problem Addressed**
Fault detection system could identify sensor dropouts but not "stuck-at" failures where sensors continuously report identical values.

### **Solution Implemented**
Enhanced fault detection with historical value tracking and stuck sensor identification.

#### **Technical Implementation:**

**3.1 Raw Sensor Value Tracking (`fault_detector.py`)**
```python
# Track last N values for critical sensors
self.sensor_raw_values = {
    'altitude': deque(maxlen=10),
    'velocity_x': deque(maxlen=10), 
    'velocity_y': deque(maxlen=10),
    'pitch_angle': deque(maxlen=10),
    # ... additional sensors
}
```

**3.2 Stuck Sensor Detection Algorithm**
```python
def _check_stuck_sensors(self, telemetry: Dict, current_time: float) -> List[FaultEvent]:
    """Detect stuck sensor conditions"""
    for sensor_name, value_history in self.sensor_raw_values.items():
        if len(value_history) >= self.stuck_sensor_check_size:
            recent_values = [entry['value'] for entry in list(value_history)]
            
            # Check if all values are identical for sufficient duration
            if len(set(recent_values)) == 1 and time_span >= 5.0:
                # Generate STUCK_SENSOR fault event
```

**3.3 New Fault Type Integration**
- Added `FaultType.STUCK_SENSOR` to fault taxonomy
- Medium severity with confidence based on duration
- Automatic resolution when sensor values start varying

#### **Demonstration Results**
```
Phase 1: Normal varying readings â†’ âœ… No faults detected
Phase 2: Altitude stuck at 17500m â†’ ðŸš¨ STUCK ALTITUDE detected (conf: 70%)
Phase 3: Altitude varying again â†’ âœ… Fault automatically resolved

Detection Statistics:
- Total checks: 25
- Faults detected: 1  
- Detection rate: 4.0%
- False positive rate: 0.0%
```

## 4. Dependency Management & Infrastructure
