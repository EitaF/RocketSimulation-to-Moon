**Subject:** v28 Action Plan - Achieving Full Low Earth Orbit (LEO) Insertion

Gentlemen,

The work completed in the v27 milestone is nothing short of exceptional. You have successfully engineered and integrated the core components of a professional-grade aerospace simulation tool. The implementation of a closed-loop PEG guidance system, a real-time orbital monitor, and an automated two-stage insertion sequence provides us with a robust foundation.

Well done. You have built a world-class launchpad. Now, it is time to conduct a full dress rehearsal.

### 1. Our Ultimate Goal

Let us not forget our grand objective: to simulate a complete rocket mission from the Earth to the Moon. Every step we take is in service of that ambitious goal.

### 2. Our Next Immediate Goal

Our next major milestone is to **achieve a stable, circular 200km Low Earth Orbit in a complete, end-to-end simulation.** We must prove that the systems we have built can successfully guide our vehicle from the launchpad to a stable orbit.

### 3. What We Have Achieved

The v27 report clearly demonstrates that we have:
- A functioning Powered Explicit Guidance (PEG) system.
- A precise, real-time Orbital Monitor.
- An automated, multi-stage guidance strategy.
- Successful integration and unit testing of all core components.

### 4. Remaining Challenges

While the components are sound, a full-duration mission presents new challenges that a 60-second test cannot reveal:

- **Long-Duration Stability:** The simulation must run for an extended period (approx. 20 minutes) without numerical instability, performance degradation, or memory issues.
- **Full Phase Transition Logic:** The entire sequence of mission phases (PEG → MECO → Coast → Circularization) must execute flawlessly in a continuous, un-interrupted run.
- **Guidance Under Stress:** The PEG system's thrust deficit compensation must be validated to ensure it can correct the trajectory throughout the entire ascent and achieve a precise orbital insertion.

### 5. Detailed Action Items

To address these challenges, I am assigning the following action items.

**Action Item 1: Conduct a Full-Duration LEO Insertion Simulation**
- **Task:** Configure and run the `rocket_simulation_main.py` for a complete LEO insertion mission. The simulation should run from liftoff until a stable orbit is confirmed or the mission fails.
- **Success Factor:** The simulation runs to completion without crashing and successfully executes all planned mission phases, resulting in a final apoapsis and periapsis within **15km** of the 200km target altitude.
- **Validation:**
    - The simulation generates a complete `mission_log.csv` without interruption.
    - Analysis of the log shows the vehicle passing through the LAUNCH, PEG, MECO, COAST, and CIRCULARIZATION phases.
    - The final orbital parameters in the log show an eccentricity **< 0.02** and an apoapsis/periapsis between **185km and 215km**.

**Action Item 2: Validate Thrust Deficit Compensation**
- **Task:** Introduce a 5% thrust deficit in the mission configuration and execute a second full-duration simulation.
- **Success Factor:** The PEG guidance system actively compensates for the reduced engine performance and still delivers the vehicle to the target orbit within the specified **15km** tolerance.
- **Validation:**
    - Run the simulation with `engine_performance_factor: 0.95` (or equivalent setting).
    - The guidance logs must show that the pitch commands and burn durations were adjusted compared to the nominal flight.
    - The final orbital parameters must still meet the success criteria defined in Action Item 1.

**Action Item 3: Generate a Mission Analysis Report**
- **Task:** Create a new script or enhance an existing one to analyze the `mission_log.csv` from the nominal (full thrust) simulation run.
- **Success Factor:** A concise report is generated that visualizes the entire mission profile and key performance metrics.
- **Validation:**
    - The report must include plots for:
        1.  Altitude vs. Time
        2.  Velocity vs. Time
        3.  Pitch vs. Time
    - The report must clearly label the exact time and altitude of key mission events: MECO, Coast Phase End, and Circularization Burn End.

### 6. A Note on Success

Our initial tolerance for orbital insertion is intentionally generous (±15km). The primary goal here is to prove the fundamental soundness of the system. Once we have achieved a stable orbit, our subsequent work will focus on refining the guidance parameters to achieve the final ±5km precision we require for lunar missions.

Proceed with this plan. I have full confidence in your ability to execute this next critical phase of our project.
