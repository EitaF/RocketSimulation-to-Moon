# Professor Feedback v31: Achieving TLI-Capable Vehicle Performance

**To:** Rocket Simulation Engineering Team  
**From:** The Professor  
**Date:** 2025-07-04  
**Subject:** Feedback on v30 Implementation and Action Plan for v31

### **Overall Assessment**

Thank you for the comprehensive report. The team's work is exemplary, not just in implementation but in the rigorous testing and analysis that followed. Discovering the S-IVB performance gap is not a failure, but a **critical success of your validation process**. This is precisely what engineering is about: confronting the limitations of the design and making informed decisions.

Here is my feedback for the next phase.

### **1. Ultimate Goal**

Our ultimate goal remains unchanged: to successfully simulate a complete rocket mission, launching from Earth and achieving a stable orbit around the Moon.

### **2. Next Milestone: Achieving TLI-Capable Vehicle Performance**

The v30 report has correctly identified a critical blocker: the S-IVB stage, as currently configured, cannot produce the required delta-V for Trans-Lunar Injection. Therefore, our next milestone must be to **resolve the vehicle's performance deficit to enable a successful TLI burn.**

### **3. Achievements**

I want to commend the team on several outstanding achievements:

-   **Robust Validation:** Creating `test_tli_burn.py` was a brilliant move. It isolated the TLI maneuver and allowed for focused testing, which directly led to the discovery of the performance gap. This is a testament to a mature engineering process.
-   **Correct Physics Implementation:** The `tli_guidance.py` module now correctly calculates the required C3 energy and delta-V. The guidance system knows what to do, even if the hardware can't yet execute it.
-   **Detailed Logging:** The enhanced mission results provide the exact data needed to diagnose performance shortfalls, which is invaluable.

### **4. Remaining Challenges**

The primary challenge has shifted:

-   **Critical Priority: S-IVB Performance Deficit:** The ~1350 m/s delta-V shortfall is the main obstacle preventing progress.
-   **Dependent Challenges:** The successful implementation of patched conics, intercept timing, and mid-course corrections all depend on having a vehicle that can actually begin the trans-lunar journey.

### **5. Detailed Action Items for Phase v31**

Your report correctly identified the potential solutions. Now, we must formalize the decision-making process.

#### **Action 1: Resolve S-IVB Performance Deficit (Top Priority)**

-   **Task:** Analyze the trade-offs between re-engineering the vehicle and re-profiling the mission. You must select and implement one of the following strategies:
    -   **Option A (Vehicle Re-engineering):** Increase the S-IVB's propellant mass or specific impulse (`Isp`). This represents a "hardware" upgrade.
    -   **Option B (Mission Re-profiling):** Reduce the payload mass for the TLI phase. This represents a "mission planning" adjustment.
    -   **Option C (Advanced Mission Re-profiling):** Implement a multi-burn TLI strategy, where the vehicle performs multiple smaller burns at perigee to gradually raise its apogee. This is more complex but can overcome engine limitations.
-   **Success Factor:** The `test_tli_burn.py` simulation successfully achieves a final C3 energy within the target range of **-2.0 to -1.5 km²/s²**.
-   **Validation:**
    1.  Create a brief markdown document named `tli_performance_trade_study.md` that documents your chosen option and the reasons for your decision.
    2.  Run `test_tli_burn.py` and confirm that the output shows the trajectory is hyperbolic and the final C3 is within the required range.

#### **Action 2: Implement Patched Conic Approximation (Parallel Task)**

-   **Task:** This task remains relevant and can be worked on in parallel. Model the transition from Earth's Sphere of Influence (SOI) to the Moon's SOI.
-   **Success Factor:** The simulation correctly identifies the SOI crossing and switches the primary gravitational body, causing the trajectory to bend towards the Moon.
-   **Validation:**
    1.  Log the SOI crossing event (timestamp, state) in `mission_log.csv`.
    2.  The trajectory plot should visually confirm the spacecraft has been "captured" into a hyperbolic flyby path relative to the Moon.

#### **Action 3: Develop Optimal TLI Burn Timing Logic**

-   **Task:** This remains a critical step for the final mission. Calculate the required orbital phasing to ensure the spacecraft intercepts the Moon.
-   **Success Factor:** The simulation initiates the TLI burn at a time that results in a close lunar approach.
-   **Validation:**
    1.  A visualization plot showing the orbits of both the spacecraft and the Moon, confirming an intercept. The script should report the closest approach distance.

#### **Action 4: Scope Mid-Course Correction (MCC) System**

-   **Task:** This design task is still valuable. Create the function stub and design document.
-   **Success Factor:** A documented function stub, `calculate_mcc_burn()`, and a corresponding `mcc_design_notes.md` file.
-   **Validation:** The existence and content of the `mcc_design_notes.md` file.

### **6. Final Guidance**

Do not be discouraged by the performance gap. Real-world space missions—from Apollo to Artemis—are a story of constantly balancing vehicle capability with mission ambition. Your simulation has reached a new level of realism by forcing you to confront this fundamental trade-off.

Your priority is clear: make the TLI burn successful. Analyze your options, make an engineering choice, and implement it. I look forward to seeing a successful trans-lunar trajectory in the next report.
