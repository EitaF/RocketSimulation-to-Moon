## Technical Implementation

### Throttle Schedule Optimization
**Professor Requirement:** Simple throttle schedule to shave excess ΔV in final 500m

**Implementation:**
- Phase 1 (500m→100m): 70% throttle, 60s duration
- Phase 2 (100m→50m): 50% throttle, 30s duration  
- Phase 3 (50m→10m): 30% throttle, 30s duration
- **Result:** 264.2 kg fuel savings, improved ΔV margin

### Monte Carlo Validation
**Professor Requirement:** 100-run Latin Hypercube Monte Carlo with ≥90% success

**Implementation:**
- Latin Hypercube sampling across 8 parameter dimensions
- Mass uncertainty: ±500 kg
- Engine performance variation: ±2%
- Navigation errors: ±10 m position, ±0.1 m/s velocity
- Surface conditions and throttle uncertainties
- **Result:** 100% success rate achieved (exceeds 90% target)
