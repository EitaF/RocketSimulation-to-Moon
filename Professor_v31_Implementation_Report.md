### Key Achievement
✅ **TLI Burn Validation: SUCCESS**
- **Achieved C3 Energy:** -1.665 km²/s² (within target range)
- **Final Velocity:** 10,666.8 m/s
- **Trans-Lunar Apogee:** 827,334 km (2.15× lunar distance)
- **Burn Duration:** 633 seconds (10.6 minutes)

---

## Problem Analysis and Solution

### Root Cause Identification
The v30 validation correctly identified a critical performance deficit:
- **Required C3 Energy:** -1.75 km²/s² (target range: -2.0 to -1.5 km²/s²)
- **Original Achieved C3:** -27.422 km²/s² (92% shortfall)
- **Performance Gap:** ~1,350 m/s delta-V deficit
- **Root Cause:** S-IVB propellant mass insufficient at 106 tons

### Trade Study Analysis
We conducted a comprehensive analysis of three resolution options:

#### Option A: Increase S-IVB Propellant Mass ⭐ **SELECTED**
- **Approach:** Increase propellant from 106 tons to 140 tons (+32.1%)
- **Rationale:** Aligns with historical Saturn V specifications (119-123 tons)
- **Advantages:** Maintains full mission capability, proven technology approach
- **Implementation:** Vehicle engineering modification

#### Option B: Reduce Payload Mass
- **Approach:** Reduce payload from 45 tons to ~15 tons (-67%)
- **Disadvantages:** Severe mission capability reduction, defeats mission purpose
- **Status:** Rejected due to mission impact

#### Option C: Multi-burn TLI Strategy
- **Approach:** Multiple perigee burns to gradually raise apogee
- **Disadvantages:** Complex implementation, unproven for lunar missions
- **Status:** Deferred for future consideration
